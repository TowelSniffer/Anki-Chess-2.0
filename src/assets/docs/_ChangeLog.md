## Version: 1.2.04

1. some changes to the look of the border that I like
2. I have changed the scoring colours to ones that will work better with dark and light themes (Light theme coming soon). I will eventually allow customizing these. Perfect colour is now magenta. Gold looked like yellow and blue wasn't great as its already being used for alt line arrows. 
3. Added colours to some nags in the Viewer
4. Fixed crash with sequential comments on PGN
5. Added support for different config options on multi sided note templates


## Version: 1.2.03

1. Fixed a bug with last updates engine buffer preventing multiPV lines from rendering
2. Fixed getures activating on board interactions. Note: on ankidroid, gestures can't be prevented unless you switch to new study screen, but this currently doesn't support js api, so auto advance wont work. Can't have your cake and eat it too in this case.
3. Fixed out of time logic triggering when timer is disabled. No more red flash on load.
4. user can now set handicap to 0 to disable.
5. Fixed perfect vs correct scoring logic. Perfect (Gold): No mistakes and timer not out of time. Correct (Green): Mistakes were under handicap value, or timer ran out. If both timer and handicap are disabled, it will just be green or red on any mistake.

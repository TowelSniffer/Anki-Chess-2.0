## Customising your ankiChess Notes

This addon can be customised to allow for many different types of cards. Config options can be saved on a per note basis (Or card if you want to make multi sided notes). Using Anki's built in tools for managing note types you can clone this template to have "ankiChess", "chess flipped", "chess Study" etc. Refer to the examples section in the "about ankiChess" menu in the template for possible setup examples. 

The anki chess [Companion Addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1300975327) will handle auto updating multiple note types.
